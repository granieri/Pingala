This is a Python script that takes a user input, n, and computes 2^n using the algorithm outlined by Pingala in *Chandaḥśāstra*.

The script is designed to show the algorithm step-by-step. Right now, it only shows the steps to computation after a binary sequence has been generated. Here is an example of what the script does:

```
Please enter a number: 6
multiplying 1 by 2 yielded 2
squaring 2 yielded 4
multiplying 4 by 2 yielded 8
squaring 8 yielded 64
2^6 is 64
```

I learned about this algorithm in the article "[The Power of Two...in Poetry?](http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/article/The_Power_of_Two_._._._in_Poetry%3F/2298573/276852/article.html)" by Amy Shell-Gellasch and J.B. Thoo, which was published in *Math Horizons* in November 2015.
